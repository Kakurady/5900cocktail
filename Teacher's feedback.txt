The program you sent seems like a promising start. It has some UI issues
which translate into lack of clarity, making the game difficult to play,
but should be straightforward to fix. The teaching mode also needs more
feedback on the errors -- just telling the player that the mix is wrong
doesn't help, you should give more specific instructions about what went
wrong and advice about how to fix it.

The main UI issue is the lack of feedback on player actions. In a real
bartending scenario, you would be able to see how much liquid was in the
glass, and whether you were starting with an empty glass or a partly filled
glass. So, you should show some visual representation of the drink in
progress: just a box with a colored rectangle showing the liquid rising up.
Also, the bartender doesn't pour by clicking, but by pouring or spraying
from a nozzle; rather than clicking, how about you hold down the mouse to
slowly pour into a measuring cup? Then you can add the measure to the drink
with a click. The measure would slowly fill; it would have markings on the
side showing 0.5 oz, 1 oz, etc.

Continuous rather than discrete pouring would better approximate the real
task and also fit with your plan to have pouring based on physical actions
with the cell phone.

The key thing, though, is to have the visual depiction of the drink and the
measure to add. Without this the game is very difficult to figure out.

Hope this helps!
